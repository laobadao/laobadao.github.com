This week, watch how you talk to yourself and others about your willpower failures and successes:

  - Do you tell yourself you’ve been “good” when you succeed at a willpower challenge, and
“bad” when you give in to procrastination or temptation?
  - Do you use your “good” behavior to give yourself permission to do something “bad”? Is
this a harmless reward, or is it sabotaging your larger willpower goals?
